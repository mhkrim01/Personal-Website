        <h4>Where I'm From</h4>

        My name is Michael Krimm, or just Mike, and I'm from Meade county, Kentucky which is about an hour southwest of Louisville.
        I come from a large and amazing family; myself, my younger brother, 3 older sisters, and Mom and Dad. Oh, and we have a few amazing dogs, Bubba and Zeus.
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>

        Hiking, painting, and drawing are a few of my favorite hobbies. I love being creative and finding new and cool outlets in which I can express myself.
        I have to say my favorite medium of expression is through my art. Something about being able to pick up a pen or brush and create something truly original is just awesome.
        I've never taken an art lesson outside of the stuff from school, so I'm completely self taught, and I have to say I don't think I'm terrible. Hiking has always been one of my
        favorite activites, since I grew up surrounded by nature. I have a strong appreciation of the outdoors and all the wonderful things it beholds.

        <h4>Education</h4>

        I graduated from Meade County Highschool in 2015 and started my college career shortly thereafter at the University of Louisville. UofL always seemed like a very exciting,
        and diverse university. Originally, I planned to attend the JB Speed School of Engineering because math and science are some of my favorite topics, but due to the rigors of the program
        and my working a third shift job trying to pay for school, I quickly came to realize that path was not realistic. After some searching and contemplation, I decided to switch
        to the business school and pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems. I figured I'd be able to apply my problem solving and critical thinking skills to real world problems in a practical way,
        and so far I've learned a lot and met some amazing people. I'm excited, though somewhat nervous, to see what kind of path will unfold after my graduation in 2019.

        <h4>Career</h4>

        I chose my major in Computer Information Systems because I saw it as a way for me to make an impact in today's world. More and more aspects
        of our daily lives are being impacted by technology with all its positives and negatives, so having a knowledge base that allows me to better understand
        and grapple with the challenges we're going to face will benefit not only me, but many others in my life. Currently, I'm working as an IT Intern at Waystar, where I'm gaining hands on
        experience developing real world applications. I'm trying to gain as much experience as possible before I graduate so that
        I can become a more well rounded developer and can contribute more with my work. If you're interested in some of my experience, check out
        my resume, posted below, for a quick overview.
